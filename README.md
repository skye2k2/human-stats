# human-stats

Being human is hard. This project does the heavy lifting required to distill your human experience into easy-to-understand stats and achievements.

I have personally found that gamification actually helps increase desire to complete tasks that otherwise might not be appealing, and may potentially never be completed. By simultaneously oversimplifying and overcomplicating an individual human experience, the hope is that you can identify both the part of you that are worth celebrating, as well as easily identify areas where you may not be a well-developed, and be able to continually chip away at flaws while reinforcing strengths, to the betterment of you as a whole.

Dungeons & Dragons does a good job of providing discrete character attributes that then impact specific skills or abilities, in addition to having specialized proficiencies, traits, and equipment that also interact with these values, and a backstory that establishes how you make decisions and interact with others. For example, having a high intelligence naturally grants a greater chance of success when performing an investigation check of your surroundings, which you may do constantly because of your highly suspicious nature. As your personal real-life situation likely deals with a few more scenarios than these stats can easily deal with, some modifications to this structure have been made.

## Human

Base stats:

**Physical** (Vitality)

- Strength (how much you can do)
- Dexterity (how well can you do it)
- Endurance/Stamina (how long you can do it)
- 5 Senses

**Mental** (Cognition)

- Intelligence (how much you understand)
- Wisdom (how well you apply what you understand)
<!--- Experience (what you have learned in the process)-->
- Discipline/Persistence/Conviction/Dedication (how well you stick with a decision)

**Special** (generally having both a mental and a physical component)

- Karma
- Skills
- Injuries
- Habits
- Hobbies

A person's overall **level** is calculated by summing their individual base stats (not skills, but still including modifiers resulting from advanced skills), and determining the iteration count in the Fibonacci sequence.

| Level                   	| Point Total 	|
|-------------------------	|-------------	|
| 0                       	| 0           	|
| 1                       	| 1           	|
| 2                       	| 2           	|
| 3                       	| 3           	|
| 4 (typical teen)        	| 5           	|
| 5                       	| 8           	|
| 6 (typical adult)       	| 13          	|
| 7                       	| 21          	|
| 8 ("skilled" person)    	| 34          	|
| 9 (discipline master)   	| 55          	|
| 10                      	| 89          	|
| 11 (world-class master) 	| 144         	|
| 12                      	| 233         	|
| 13                      	| 377         	|
| 14                      	| 610         	|
| 15                      	| 987         	|

<summary>Lifelong Underachiever Example:</summary>

Hank attended public school until sophomore year of high school, dropped out, held various unskilled manual labor jobs for 50 years, ate out for most of his meals, spent most every evening either drinking and watching television at home or at the local sports bar, and is now retiring.

Obtaining a 9th grade education is just enough to earn Hank a point of intelligence, but the dropout achievement loses him that point, again. Becoming a legal adult and not dying within a year grants him a milestone achievement, gaining him another point of intelligence and wisdom. Performing manual labor for decades resulted in achievements that boosted strength, dexterity, and endurance two points each, but reaching age 65 without a workout regimen in place loses him one of each, again. Working his adult life, instead of choosing unemployment grants him an achievement gaining him two points of discipline, but his habit of going out drinking every night loses him one.

- Strength: 1
- Dexterity: 1
- Endurance: 1

- Intelligence: 1
- Wisdom: 1
- Discipline: 1

- Karma: 0

A total of attribute point total of 6 ranks Hank at a level 4, which is a level or two lower than you would expect for a typical adult.

<summary>Young Dedicated Example:</summary>

Xavier attended a private school emphasizing in laying the groundwork for engineering professions, played on a club volleyball team and practiced a martial art and an instrument for all of his teenage years, completed his bachelor's degree at an Ivy League school, spends his free time on various maker projects, and is starting the first job of his professional career as a systems engineer.

Successfully completing specialized schooling gains Xavier three points of intelligence and one of wisdom. Eight years of martial arts boosts strength, dexterity, and endurance two points each. Playing volleyball during that time pushes dexterity and endurance up one point. Practicing an instrument for an extended amount of time grants a point to each of intelligence and discipline. Keeping with three different hobbies until they return dividends grants him a dedicated achievement which nets him another two points in discipline and one in wisdom. Completing a secondary education gives another point in each of intelligence, wisdom, and discipline. Becoming a legal adult and not dying within a year grants him a milestone achievement, gaining him another point of intelligence and wisdom. Practicing a hobby that pushes problem-solving abilities grants a point to intelligence and wisdom.

- Strength: 2
- Dexterity: 3
